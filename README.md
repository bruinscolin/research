# Graph Construction and Computational Geometry

This repository contains a Java-based implementation of a Cal Poly research project regarding computational geometry and graphing: [“Characterization and Computation of Feasible
Trajectories for an Articulated Probe with a
Variable-Length End Segment”](https://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~kteo/pub/cgta21_1.pdf) by Ovidiu Daescu, Ka Yaw Teo.

## 📚 Overview

The project aims to visualize the problem defined in the paper: Find the minimum length r > 0 of line segment bc such that
a feasible articulated probe trajectory exists, and report (at least) one such
trajectory, or report that no feasible solution exists.

## 🛠️ Features

- Interactive drawing canvas for visualizing line segments and their visibility connections.
- Implementation of algorithms to compute visibility graphs based on the provided segment sets.
- Modular code structure facilitating easy integration of additional features or algorithms.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

### Compilation and Execution

1. Navigate to the `src` directory:

   ```bash
   cd src
   ```

2. Compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   java App
   ```
